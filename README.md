# Hi, I am Louis Borres 👋

📍 Based in Cebu, Philippines


I began my career as a Software Engineer in May of 2022. I had quickly discovered how much I enjoyed solving problems involving software and have since been passionately honing my skills.

Feel free to contact me. I would love to hear about your next project idea.
